# ==========
# create a csv report on stdout summarizing the bomcheck output for an agts
# of ship2tk run. ksh is specified on the shebang line because the '-nt' 
# option of test is used to see if bomcheck's most recent run was successful.
#
# to create the report in excel from the output csv file, bring it into excel
# with Data->InportExternalData->ImportData. Mark column 'C', wrap the text 
# using Format->Cells->AlignmentTab->WrapText->OK. You can also use 
# Format->Cells as needed to coltrol colors and fonts. 


# ----------
# bomcheck puts its reports in different directories depending on how it is run.

# ----------
# create a temporary file containing all of the SHIP, TK and TK/PROD lines from
# the bomcheck output in the output directory. only components that have passed
# the agts run are included in the report.
